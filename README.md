## Kaggle Competition:

You can view the Kaggle competition page using this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/contradictory-my-dear-watson).

## Learning method:

To be determined after more research and experimentation.

## Proposal:
The problem we are trying to solve is a Natural language problem detecting when two sentences are related or not in 15 different languages, we sort them into 3 categories. Unrelated, Contradicting or one entails the other. This problem is a particularly interesting one because this sort of language processing can help immensely when it comes to grammar checking, context identification, fact checking/fake news detection.

The team will be analyzing existing papers that may be using sentences as the focus of their algorithm and learn how sentences are processed. We will look for algorithms applied to similar problems in the past and try to improve them. Since the algorithm will be one involving Natural Language Processing, we will research one relevant to the question at hand. Mainly, we want to adapt an algorithm in order to accomplish its task with the 15 different languages.

As for the data, the Kaggle competition provides training and evaluation data sets in 15 languages

( Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Thai, Turkish, Urdu and Vietnamese ).

We are going to be evaluating our results quantitatively, by seeing how many sentences we were able to guess correctly and providing accuracy scores for oru predictions with the use of a test data set. We will also explore plotting the results across the different languages using a bar chart.
